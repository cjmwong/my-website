                    About Me
                <p class="text">My name is Calvin and I am a ex-Civil Engineer graduate that has discovered his
                    interest in coding. I have been writing code for a little over a year now and am still consistently
                    improving my ability to code and working my way to becoming a software engineer.

                    Projects
                <p class="text">A list of my projects can be found on my github. So far, I have completed coursework projects in my data structure and
                    algorithms class using Python. Currently, I am learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript so that I can independently create
                    my first full stack web application.

                    Experience
                    <p class="text">
                        During my civil engineering internships, I have coded using excel. The work itself consisted mainly the use of procedural programming,
                        to sort and organize data in an excel spreadsheet.
                        In my current employment, I edit HTML to make changes to the company website, and update the website with up-to-date information.
